              >Vipassana meditation
            </a>
            as taught by S. N. Goenka in the tradition of Sayagyi U Ba Khin. I
            try to join at least one 10-day retreat every year apart from
            maintaining a daily practise of 2 hours. The technique of meditation
            employed here is quite pragmatic: focussing on one's own respiration
            to calm down the mind and then observing the various different
            sensations on the body equanimously to purify the mind. Of course,
            it takes time and dedication. I have found that over the years
            Vipassana has helped me improve myself in all walks of life. I can't
            recommend this enough if you are looking for a complete reboot and
            to get to know a deeper part of yourself. The courses are conducted
            in a 10-day residential format and are offered free of cost in over
            200 centers around the world. All the costs in this wonderful
            tradition are covered by donations coming from grateful old
            students.

          <h3>Literature</h3>
          <p>
            I am quite fond of Hindi poetry, especially from the
            <em>Chhayawaad</em> period between 1922-1938. The poetic style of
            this period makes heavy use of Sanskrit vocabulary and uses strict
            rules of meter/rhyme. My favorite Poetess is
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahadevi_Varma"
              target="_blank"
              class="text-color"
              >Mahadevi Verma </a
            >, one of the 4 pillars of <em>Chhayawaad</em>. A melodius
            recitation of her work titled "Jo tum aa jate ek baar" that she
            wrote for Tathagata, the Buddha, can be found
            <a

              class="text-color"
              >here </a
            >. My favorite poetic composition is the epic of
            <em>Kamayani</em> by
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaishankar_Prasad"
              target="_blank"
              class="text-color"
              >Jaishankar Prasad </a
            >, another one of the 4 pillars of <em>Chhayawaad</em>. A beautiful
            rendition of another epic poem from this era called

            vocalist Manna Dey.
